== Using the 3DR Radio for telemetry with APM 2 ==

http://wiki.ardupilot-mega.googlecode.com/git/images/3DRadio/3DR-radio-kit-dip-small.jpg

The 3DRobotics [https://store.diydrones.com/3DR_RadioTelemetry_Kit_915_Mhz_p/kt-telemetry-3dr915.htm 3DR Radio] is the ideal way to setup a telemetry
connection between your APM and a ground station. Small, inexpensive
and with great range, the 3DR radio uses an open source firmware which
allows us to do things that cannot be done with other radios.

=== Connecting your 3DR Radios ===

Important note: *You cannot connect via the radios when your APM 2 is also connected via USB (they share the same port).* Make sure you disconnect your USB cable from the APM 2 board before attempting a wireless connection. 

You will need two 3DR radios, one for your aircraft, and the other for
your ground station.

Looking at the above picture you will see that typically the "ground" radio module has a USB connector, making it easy to connect them to your ground station. It uses a D2XX FTDI driver that you can get [http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm here]. This driver is built into Windows 7 and above, so it is only necessary if you are using Windows XP or below. 

The 'aircraft' model has a FTDI six pin header, allowing it to be directly connected to your APM telemetry port. 

== For APM 2.5 ==

Use the included cable: 

http://wiki.ardupilot-mega.googlecode.com/git/images/telemcable.jpg

Plug it into the telemetry port on APM 2.5 and on the 3DR radio side, plug the connector with the red cable on the +5v pin and the black cable on the end on GND as shown:

http://wiki.ardupilot-mega.googlecode.com/git/images/IMG_5408.JPG


== For APM 2.0 ==

http://wiki.ardupilot-mega.googlecode.com/git/images/APM2/telemtry.jpg 

http://wiki.ardupilot-mega.googlecode.com/git/images/3drradio.jpg


The radios come pre-configured for a serial rate of 57600, which is
the default rate that APM uses for telemetry, but you can change this
to any rate you like, either using the AT command set, the
APM Mission Planner radio setup interface, or the [http://vps.oborne.me/3drradioconfig.zip 3DR Radio Configuration Utility].

=== Status LEDs ===

The 3DR Radios have 2 status LEDs, one red and one green. The meaning
of the different LED states is as follows:

 * green LED blinking - searching for another radio
 * green LED solid - link is established with another radio
 * red LED flashing - transmitting data
 * red LED solid - in firmware update mode

=== Configuring using the Mission Planner ===

The latest versions of the APM Mission Planner support configuring
your 3DR radios using a simple GUI interface. In the Mission Planner (top right) select the Com port that your "ground" 3DR radio is connected to and 57k as the baud rate. 

Then switch to the Configuration screen. Choose the 3DR radio tab in the list at left, and click on "Load Settings" and it will populate it with data similar to that shown (the remote radio's settings will only show if it is also powered on and connected to APM running current !ArduPlane or !ArduCopter code). 

http://wiki.ardupilot-mega.googlecode.com/git/images/3DRradio.PNG

This is the recommended configuration method for most users.

==== Serial and air rates 'one byte form' ====

The SERIAL_SPEED and AIR_SPEED parameters are in the same form that
APM uses for the SERIAL3_SPEED EEPROM parameter. It is the rate in
kbps, truncated to an integer. So '9' means 9600 baud, '38' means
38400, '115' means 115200 etc.

=== Choosing the air data rate ===

The key parameter that controls the range of your radios is the
AIR_SPEED. The default is 64 (which is 64kbps) will give you a range
of over a kilometre with small omni antennas. The lower you set the
AIR_SPEED the longer your range, although lowering the AIR_SPEED also
lowers how much data you can send over the link.

The radio firmware can only support 13 possible air date rates, which are 2, 4, 8, 16, 19, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 192 and 250. If your application needs a different air rate for some reason then we can potentially add it to the register tables. If you choose an unsupported air rate then the next highest rate from the supported list will be chosen.

What air data rate you choose will depend on the following factors

  * what range you need
  * what data rate you will be sending
  * whether you primarily send in one direction, or both
  * whether you have ECC enabled
  * whether you have an APM firmware with adaptive flow control

For most telemetry applications you will primarily be sending data mostly in
one direction, from the aircraft to the ground station. For most
people, the amount of data sent from the ground station to the
aircraft is small, just an occasional control packet plus heartbeat
packets.

If you are using a joystick to control your aircraft then you will be
sending a lot more data from the ground station to the aircraft, and
in that case you may find a higher AIR_SPEED is needed, although your
range will be reduced.

The ECC parameter makes a big difference to the data rate you can
support at a given AIR_SPEED. If you have ECC set to zero, then no
error correcting information is sent, and the radio uses a simple 16
bit CRC to detect transmission errors. In that case your radio will be
able to support data transfers in one direction of around 90% of the
AIR_SPEED.

If you enable ECC (which is highly recommended), then the data rate
you can support is halved. The ECC system doubles the size of the data
sent by the radios. It is worth it however, as the bit error rate will
drop dramatically, and you are likely to get a much more reliable link
at longer ranges.

If you have the latest APM firmware (!ArduPlane 2.33 or later, or
!ArduCopter 2.54 or later) then the APM will automatically adapt its
telemetry rates to what the radio can handle, by using MAVLink RADIO
packets injected into the MAVLink streams by the radios firmware. That
allows you to 'oversubscribe' your link, by setting up a SERIAL_SPEED
larger than what the radios can actually handle.

The other factor in choosing the air data rate is the TDM 'sync
time'. The two radios need to work out each others frequency hopping
pattern. They do this by slowly changing the receive channel while
rapidly changing the transmit channel. This process of getting in sync
with the other radio takes just a few seconds at high air data rates,
but gets slower for low air data rates.

For most amateur UAV applications the default AIR_SPEED of 64 with ECC
enabled will be good.

=== Error Correction ===

As mentioned above, the radios support a 12/24 Golay error correcting
code if you set the ECC parameter to 1. This means that for every 12
bits of data the radio will send 24 bits, calculating the bits using
Golay code lookup tables. The process is reversed on the receiving
end, and allows the radio to correct bit errors of up to 3 bits in
every 12 bits send (i.e. 25% bit error rate).

The downside of the ECC option is that it halves your available data
bandwidth, but in most cases this is worth it, as you are able to
sustain a reliable link over longer ranges. You will also get a lot
less 'noise' in the serial stream.

=== MAVLink framing ===

If you set the MAVLINK option to 1 then the radio will do 'MAVLink
framing'. The MAVLink protocol is used by APM for transmitting
telemetry date to a ground station. When MAVLink framing is used, the
radio will try to align radio packets with MAVLink packet
boundaries. This means that if a packet is lost you don't end up with
half a MAVLink packet being seen by the receiver. That partial packet
would appear as line noise on your ground stations console.

The radio firmware will try to fit multiple MAVLink packets into one
radio packet where possible for maximum efficiency. The highest radio
packet size is 252 bytes.

The radio firmware supports both the MAVLink 0.9 and the MAVLink 1.0
transmission formats.

=== MAVLink reporting ===

If you have MAVLINK set to 1, then the radio firmware will also look
for MAVLink HEARTBEAT messages coming from the serial connection. If
it sees a HEARTBEAT message then it knows that the MAVLink protocol is
in use, and it will start injecting MAVLink 'RADIO' status packets
into the the serial stream.

The RADIO packets contain information about the RSSI (Received Signal
Strength Indicator) level at both ends of the link, allowing the
ground station or aircraft to take action in case the link quality
falls too low.

The RADIO packets also contain information about error rates, and how
full the serial transmit buffer is (as a percentage). The latest APM
firmware can use this information to automatically adapt the telemetry
stream rates to the data rate that the radios can sustain.

=== Power levels ===

You need to be very careful to configure your radios to stay within
the legal power limits of the country you are operating in. The
default power level of 20dBm is fine for the US and Australia, as up
to 30dBm is allowed by the LIPD class licenses there in the 915-928MHz
frequency band for a frequency hopping radio. So as long as your
antennas have a gain of less than 10dBi you should be within the ISM
rules.

The radio cannot support arbitrary power levels. It can only support the power levels given in the following table

|| *Power (dBm)* || *Power (milliWatts)* ||
|| 1 || 1.3 ||
|| 2 || 1.6 ||
|| 5 || 3.2 ||
|| 8 || 6.3 ||
|| 11 || 12.5 ||
|| 14 || 25 ||
|| 17 || 50 ||
|| 20 || 100 ||

If you choose an unsupported power level the radio will choose the next highest power level from the above table.

Please carefully check the EIRP (Equivalent isotropically radiated power) power limits for your country, making
sure you take into account the antenna gain. The 3DR radio is a 'DIY'
radio part and it is entirely your responsibility to ensure any use of
it is compliant with local rules.

For example, if your local rules allow for a maximum of 30dBm (1W) EIRP, then if you use a amplifier with a 12dB transmit gain, and an antenna with 3dBi gain, then you will need to set TXPOWER to at most 14.

If you don't know how to calculate it, we've made a tutorial for you here: [http://code.google.com/p/ardupilot-mega/wiki/db_watt_dbm Understanding dB, Watts and dBm].

----

=== Using the AT command set ===

The 3DR radios support a variant of the Hayes 'AT' modem command set
for configuration.

If you connect with a serial console to a 3DR radio at the current
serial baud rate, you can tell the radio to enter AT command mode by
entering the sequence '+++'. To prevent data being seen as the command
sequence there is a guard time required, so make sure you type nothing
on the serial link for 1 second before and after you enter the
sequence.

When you enter AT command mode you will receive a 'OK' prompt from the
radio and it will stop displaying data sent from the other radio.

Once in AT command mode, you can give the radio either 'AT' commands
to control the local radio, or (if successfully connected) you can use
'RT' commands to control the remote radio. 

The AT commands available are:

  * ATI - show radio version
  * ATI2 - show board type
  * ATI3 - show board frequency
  * ATI4 - show board version
  * ATI5 - show all user settable EEPROM parameters
  * ATI6 - display TDM timing report
  * ATI7 - display RSSI signal report
  * ATO - exit AT command mode
  * ATSn? - display radio parameter number 'n'
  * ATSn=X - set radio parameter number 'n' to 'X'
  * ATZ - reboot the radio
  * AT&W - write current parameters to EEPROM
  * AT&F - reset all parameters to factory default
  * AT&T=RSSI - enable RSSI debug reporting
  * AT&T=TDM - enable TDM debug reporting
  * AT&T - disable debug reporting

all of these commands, except for ATO, may be used on a connected
remote radio by replacing 'AT' with 'RT'.

Perhaps the most useful command is 'ATI5' which displays all user
settable EEPROM parameters. That will produce a report like this:

{{{
 S0: FORMAT=22
 S1: SERIAL_SPEED=57
 S2: AIR_SPEED=64
 S3: NETID=25
 S4: TXPOWER=20
 S5: ECC=1
 S6: MAVLINK=1
 S7: OPPRESEND=1
 S8: MIN_FREQ=915000
 S9: MAX_FREQ=928000
 S10: NUM_CHANNELS=50
 S11: DUTY_CYCLE=100
 S12: LBT_RSSI=0
}}}

The first column is the S register to set if you want to change that
parameter. So for example, to set the transmit power to 10dBm, use
'ATS4=10'.

Most parameters only take effect on the next reboot. So the usual
pattern is to set the parameters you want, then use 'AT&W' to write
the parameters to EEPROM, then reboot using 'ATZ'. The exception is
the transmit power, which changes immediately (although it will revert
to the old setting on reboot unless you use AT&W).

The meaning of the parameter is as follows:

  * FORMAT - this is for EEPROM format version. Don't change it
  * SERIAL_SPEED - this is the serial speed in 'one byte form' (see below)
  * AIR_SPEED - this is the air data rate in 'one byte form'
  * NETID - this is the network ID. It must be the same for both your radios
  * TXPOWER - this is the transmit power in dBm. The maximum is 20dBm
  * ECC - this enables/disables the golay error correcting code
  * MAVLINK - this enables/disables MAVLink framing and reporting
  * MIN_FREQ - minimum frequency in kHz
  * MAX_FREQ - maximum frequency in kHz
  * NUM_CHANNELS - number of frequency hopping channels
  * DUTY_CYCLE - the percentage of time to allow transmit
  * LBT_RSSI - Listen Before Talk threshold (see docs below)

For two radios to communicate the following must be the same
at both ends of the link:

  * the radio firmware version
  * the AIR_SPEED
  * the MIN_FREQ
  * the MAX_FREQ
  * the NUM_CHANNELS
  * the NETID
  * the ECC setting
  * the LBT_RSSI setting

the other settings may be different at either end of the link,
although you will usually set them up the same at both ends.



=== Support for different countries/regions ===

It is very important that you find out what the local country or region regulations are on frequency, hopping channels and power levels and configure your 3DR Radios correctly for your local rules.

We'd be delighted to add more countries to this table! Please post the information on the forums, giving links to the applicable regulations and information on what it all means. Also, please point out any inaccuracies in the existing table.

Note that the above table is for most users without any special license. If you are have an application specific license or have a HAM license then you should know what rules are applicable to you.

Finally, compliance is your responsibility. The 3DR radio is a 'DIY' radio part and you need to ensure what whatever you build meets local regulations. Please check your local rules carefully.

=== Available Frequency Ranges ===

The following table may be helpful matching your local radio regulations to the two radio models available

|| *Radio* || *Minimum Frequency (MHz)* || *Maximum Frequency (MHz)* ||
|| 3DR 433 || 414.0 || 454.0 ||
|| 3DR 900 || 895.0 || 935.0 ||


=== Duty Cycle setting ===

Most users will want to set the DUTY_CYCLE to 100. The DUTY_CYCLE is the maximum percentage of time that the radio will transmit packets. 

The reason the duty cycle is included is that some regions of the world allow for higher transmit power or more frequencies if you have a duty cycle below a given threshold. So for example in Europe you can transmit on a wider range of frequencies in the 433 band if your duty cycle is below 10%.

When you set a duty cycle below 100% then your available bandwidth will be reduced, so you will find it will only work well for telemetry at higher baud rates. It is still quite practical to get good telemetry from an APM with a 10% duty cycle, as telemetry traffic is quite 'bursty', so the average transmit time is not generally high anyway.

For example, you can easily receive all telemetry streams at 2Hz with AIR_SPEED set to 128, ECC enabled and a DUTY_CYCLE set to 10.

You can also set a radio to receive only by setting the DUTY_CYCLE to 0. That will work best if you set NUM_CHANNELS to a low number, as otherwise the clock synchronisation will be poor.

=== Listen Before Talk (LBT) ===

The 3DR Radio can implement 'listen before talk' (LBT) functionality to allow it to comply with a wider range of regional regulatory requirements. LBT is a system where the radio is required to listen for a period of time and see no signal from other radios before it is allowed to transmit. By using a non-zero LBT_RSSI value your radio will become more 'polite', by waiting until everyone else has stopped transmitting before starting to transmit itself.

To enable LBT in your radio you need to set the LBT_RSSI threshold. This is the signal strength that the radio considers to be an indication that the channel is busy. If you set LBT_RSSI to zero then LBT is disabled. 

The minimum non-zero setting is 25 which is a few dB above the receive sensitivity of the radio (-121 dBm). To setup LBT_RSSI you need to know what signal level your local radio regulations require for LBT functionality. Each increment in LBT_RSSI above 25 is roughly equal to 0.5dB above the radios receive sensitivity. So if you set LBT_RSSI to 40 then the radio will consider the channel to be free if the signal strength is less than 7.5dB above the receiver sensitivity. 

Alternatively, you can use this formula to get the received signal strength in dBm:
{{{
  signal_dBm = (RSSI / 1.9) - 127
}}}
This formula is approximate, but quite close. See the Si1000 data sheet for a more precise graph.

You will need to lookup your local regulatory requirements to see what LBT_RSSI setting you should use.

The LBT implementation in the 3DR radio uses a minimum listen time of 5ms, plus randomised listen time as per the European 9.2.2.2 rules.

Note that in many regions you need to implement LBT in conjunction with AFA (Adaptive Frequency Agility). The 3DR Radio implements AFA as long as you have NUM_CHANNELS set to more than 1.

=== Technical Details ===

When evaluating if this radio meets your local regulations it may be helpful to know what technology it uses.

The firmware implements frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) with synchronous adaptive time division multiplexing (TDM). 

Specifically, the radio divides up the frequency range between MIN_FREQ+delta and MAX_FREQ-delta into NUM_CHANNELS channels. The 'delta' value is a guard range to ensure that we stay well away from the edges of the allowed band. The guard range is set to half a channel width. The channel width is defined as:
{{{
  channel_width = (MAX_FREQ - MIN_FREQ) / (NUM_CHANNELS+2)
}}}

Additionally, the radio skews the base frequency by up to one channel using a random seed based on NETID. This means that two radios using different NETID numbers use slightly different frequencies.

The radios use GFSK (Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying) for transmission on a particular frequency.

The TDM works by dividing up time into slices, based on multiples of 16 microsecond ticks. The time slicing is designed to give a maximum dwell time on any frequency of 0.4s (this is to meet US regulations). The TDM algorithm then works as follows:

  * the EEPROM parameters determine a set of TDM parameters, particularly the transmit window and silence period, both are in 16 microsecond units. You can view the results using ATI6.
  * the transmit window is scaled to allow for 3 full sized packets to be transmitted
  * the silence period is equal to twice the packet latency, for the given data rate
  * The two radios synchronise their clocks automatically by adding 13 bits of timestamp information to all packets. The timestamp is in 16 microsecond units.
  * Each radio only transmits when it is 'their turn'. So a radio gets one transmit window worth of time, then there is a silence period when neither radio transmits, then the other radio gets its turn. We never have the situation where both radios transmit at the same time
  * the transmit channels are organised into a random sequence based on the NETID
  * the frequency is changed to the next channel twice for each full TDM round, during the silence periods
  * when not transmitting, data that comes in over the serial port is buffered in a 2048 byte buffer
  * to prevent the buffer from getting too much data (which increases latency and risks overflow) the radios send information on how full the buffer is to the connected device. The APM code adapts its telemetry rates by small amounts to keep the amount of buffered data reasonable. 
  * The TDM algorithm is also adaptive, in the sense that when it is the turn of radio A to transmit, it can send a small token to radio B saying "I don't need to send anything right now, you can take the rest of my timeslice". That is how the link auto-balances for asymmetric loads
  * during the initial search for another radio, and any time the link is lost, the radios go into a mode where they move the receiving frequency very slowly but move the transmit frequency at the normal rate. This allows the two radios to find each other for initial clock sync. How long this takes depends on the number of channels, the air data rate and the packet loss rate. 


In some regions you may need to know the distribution of radiated energy within each channel. That depends on a number of factors, but mostly the frequency deviation used for the GFSK modulation. The following formula will give you an estimate of the frequency deviation:
{{{
   frequency_deviation = air_data_rate * 1.2
   min freq deviation = 40
   max freq deviation = 159
}}}
where frequency_deviation is in kHz and the air_data_rate is in kilo bits per second.

=== Using a bi-directional amplifier for very long range ===

You can combined a 3DR Radio with a bi-directional amplifier in order
to extend the range to very long distances.

We have had a lot of success testing amplifiers made by
[https://www.shireeninc.com/ Shireen]. In particular, Shireen were
kind enough to donate a 900MHz amplifier which we tested with a pair
of 900MHz 3DR radios.

http://wiki.ardupilot-mega.googlecode.com/git/images/3DRadio/Shireen_amplifier.jpg

This amplifier gives 12dB transmit gain, and 18dB receive gain,
automatically switching between transmit and receive modes when the
radio starts and stops transmitting. It can either run on 5V from a
UBEC, or can use a builtin switching regulator with a 2S or 3S !LiPo.

We tested this amplifier at one end of a 7.6km link between two hills
in Canberra, Australia. At one end we had a simple wire antenna, and
at the other end we had a cheap eBay 3.5dBi omni antenna, plus the
Shireen amplifier.

This was the test rig at the end without the amplifier

http://wiki.ardupilot-mega.googlecode.com/git/images/3DRadio/TestRig.jpg

With the following setting:

{{{
 S0: FORMAT=22
 S1: SERIAL_SPEED=9
 S2: AIR_SPEED=24
 S3: NETID=25
 S4: TXPOWER=14
 S5: ECC=1
 S6: MAVLINK=1
 S7: OPPRESEND=1
 S8: MIN_FREQ=915000
 S9: MAX_FREQ=928000
 S10: NUM_CHANNELS=50
}}}

we found that we got a great link at 7.6 km range. We then
progressively lowered the transmit power at each end of the link in
order to measure the 'fade margin', which allows us to estimate how
far the radios could transmit at full power. We found that the fade
margin was about 12dB at both ends, which implies that the radios
should have been able to sustain a link at approximately 4x the range
we tested over.

Note that if you use an amplifier (or high gain antenna) you need to be very careful not to exceed the EIRP level that your local rules allow.

=== Monitoring the link quality ===

You can use the MAVLink support in the 3DR Radios to monitor the link
quality while flying, if your ground station supports it.

The two key message parameters are RADIO.rssi and RADIO.remrssi. The
first is the RSSI (signal strength) level that the local radio is
receiving at. The remrssi parameter is the RSSI that the remote radio
is receiving at.

Here is a typical graph of the RSSI levels for a flight at my local
flying field.

http://wiki.ardupilot-mega.googlecode.com/git/images/3DRadio/rssi-distance.png

The RSSI value scales approximately as 1.9x the dBm signal strength,
plus an offset. See the Si1000 data sheet for the exact mapping
between RSSI and dBm received signal strength, or use this approximate formula
{{{
  signal_dBm = (RSSI / 1.9) - 127
}}}

The reason the RSSI varies so much during this flight is that the
signal is attenuated when the plane is rolled over in a turn as I was
using a simple wire antenna in the plane. The RSSI values for this
flight were plenty high enough for the link quality to be excellent
throughout the flight using the default radio parameters.

=== What range can I expect? ===

The most common question about a telemetry radio is what range you can
get with it. It is also a difficult question to answer, as it depends
on so many factors.

We have done a lot of test flights to try to gauge what the practical
range of these radios is with small omnidirectional antennas and no
amplifiers. Here is a typical result:

http://wiki.ardupilot-mega.googlecode.com/git/images/3DRadio/3DR-915-txpower2-64kbps-ECC.png

In this case the 3DR 900 radios were setup with default parameters,
except that the TXPOWER had been set to 2 dBm, which means they were
transmitting with just 1.6% of their maximum power. Theoretically, a
radios range doubles with each additional 6 dB of transmit power, so
the range achieved with this test should be about 1/8 of the range
that the radios can achieve at an air rate of 64kbps. That is why the
above graph shows the distance in meters times 8. This was on a tiny
!SkyFun model, and I wanted to keep the plane where I could see it,
which is why I did the test with reduced transmit power rather than
just flying it a long distance.

The radios kept a perfect link throughout this flight, so we are
confident that these radios will achieve a few kilometers range in
practice. In this particular case I was flying with a small 'wire'
antenna in the !SkyFun and was using a cheap eBay 3.5dBi antenna on the
ground station.

Of course, the range would be considerably better if I had dropped the
air data rate. I find 64kbps to be a good rate for general use, but I
tend to use 24 kbps if I am wanting to test at longer ranges.

The range of these radios has also been confirmed by other users. For example, I was sent a log showing a good link kept over a flight of 4.5km from the base station, using default radio settings for a 3DR 900 radio.  That was using a small omni antenna in the plane, and a 8dB patch antenna on the ground station. The signal level in the log suggests it could have gone quite a bit further.

=== Diagnosing range problems ===

If you get less range than you would expect from the above information
then what you need to do is graph the noise and signal levels from a
flight to work out what the problem is.

The most common source of range problems is noise. Noise is unwanted
radio emissions in the same frequency range that your radio is using
that interferes with the operation of your radio. The 3DR radios have
telemetry logging built in to help you diagnose the source of the
noise.

There are three key types of noise that are likely to affect your 3DR
radios
  * noise from the electronics in your aircraft (such as your motor, ESC, APM etc)
  * noise from your ground station computer, especially its USB bus
  * noise from other people operating radios nearby that are on the same frequency as your 3DR radios

To work out what sort of noise you have, open up mission planner and
choose the "telemetry logs" tab. Then choose "Tlog>Kml or Graph". When
the window pops up choose "Graph Log" and select a log from a test
flight with your radios. Wait for the log to load, then choose the
following items to log:
  * rssi
  * remrssi
  * noise
  * remnoise
Put all 4 values on the one graph. You will end up with a plot like
this:
http://wiki.ardupilot-mega.googlecode.com/git/images/3DRadio/diag-range-graph.png

That graph shows you 4 things:
  * the amount of signal being received on the ground
  * the amount of signal being received in the aircraft
  * the amount of noise being received on the ground
  * the amount of noise being received in the aircraft

For the best possible range you want the two noise lines to be low,
and the two signal lines to be high. In the above graph (taken from my
!SkyFun with a pair of 3DR-433 radios) you can see that the noise
levels in the plane are higher than the noise levels on the
ground. Also note that at the start of the flight (before I started
the motor) the noise levels on the plane were lower, then they went up
after I started the motor. That shows I'm getting some noise from my
motor. If I wanted more range I would need to move the radio further
from the motor and ESC.

Perhaps the most common source of noise with the 3DR-433 is noise from
the USB bus on your ground station. That shows up as high values for
the RADIO.noise value. If you get this, then you could try using a
different USB cable, or a different laptop. You can also try using a
USB hub between your laptop and your radio.

If the 'rssi' and 'noise' levels meet on the graph then you will lose
the link. To determine what your range would be, a rough rule of thumb
is to subtract the 'rssi' and 'noise' numbers, then divide by 2. That
tells you your "fade margin" in decibels. For each 6dB of fade margin
your range doubles. So if you have 18dB of fade margin, then you will
be able to do roughly 8x whatever range you were at when you measured
the margin.

Another key source of range problems is the antenna placement. Your
ground station antenna should be well clear of obstructions and a
couple of meters off the ground. You may need to build a stand to hold
it to get the best range.

=== Upgrading your radio firmware ===

The firmware for the 3DR radios is open source, and new features are
regularly added. You should check for new releases regularly to get
the most from your radios.

The easiest way to upgrade is using the APM Mission Planner. Go into
the 3DR Radio configuration screen and use the 'Upload Firmware'
button.

After you upgrade please carefully check all your settings. A firmware update may change your settings to the default values if the EEPROM format has changed.

We also encourage you to get involved in the development of the
firmware. Start by looking at the 
[https://github.com/tridge/SiK firmware source code] and contribute some patches!

=== Forcing bootloader mode ===

If you somehow manage to get your radio in a state where you can't
upload a new firmware via the Mission Planner then you may need to
force the radio into bootloader mode. 

The way firmware upload normally works is the planner connects to the
radio and sends a AT&UPDATE command to put the radio into bootloader
mode ready to receive a new firmware. That only works if the planner
can send AT commands to the radio.

If you can't send AT commands, then you can force bootloader mode by
shorting the CTS and GROUND pins on the radio while powering on. The
red LED will light up when in bootloader mode.

On the air radios the CTS and GROUND pins are easy to find, as they
are marked on the back of the radio (they are two of the FTDI
connector pins). On the USB radios it isn't as obvious, so this
diagram may help:

After you have the radio in bootloader mode you should be able to
upload a firmware.
